## Usage
Users can see the most recent posts from the homepage, but to access further functionality, they will need to create an account. Once an account is created (and the user is logged in), they will be able to create posts, edit their own posts, and comment on other users' posts (and their own).

## Functionality
The webpage will validate user login status via the session at most steps, requiring login if not logged in. 

## Tools Used
* JavaScript
* MySQL
* Sequelize
* Express.js
* Node.js
* NPM
* nodemon
* bcrypt
* Heroku
* GitHub
* GitBash
* Coded in VS Code

## Future Functionality
* The security could definitely be imporved, even with the few features I added to prevent easy manipulation of others' posts.
* Comments could become editable.
* A search feature could be implemented.
